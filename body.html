		<h3>
			Welcome to the beginning of something quite mooving.
		</h3>
		<p>
			I've decided
		to take on a big project. I want to make a index specifically for cows. I want to index ALL OF THE COWS!
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			That cow right up there is one of my favorites and is the poster cow from my homeland, the great state of Wisconsin, the Holstein. They are black and white and alright. They are mildly mannered and produce gratuitous amounts of milk to be turned into cheese. Most cows produce milk. This is just some vanilla info I know about cows in general.
		</p>
		<p>
			The reason I am doing chose to do this project is because unlike (seemingly) most people who take up programming, I don't have many ideas about "stuff" I would like to make. There are many things I would like to learn but having an idea in mind seems to be the concrete motivation you need to take on learning those things. This is to showcase all my skills, basic web design and development, thorough research, and writing.

			If you love this, or slightly like it even, come check out my other awesome site, a blog that I made where I mask complaining with "programming reflection" at <a href="https://www.mctopherganesh.com" target="_blank">mctopherganesh</a>. And for your patience and getting all the way to the bottom, here's another picture of a cow, a Jersey. I love their coats!
